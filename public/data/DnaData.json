      "description": "A turbocharger increases the engine's efficiency and power by forcing more air into the combustion chamber. Turbochargers are a key performance-enhancing component in modern engines. By increasing the amount of air entering the engine, a turbo enables a higher combustion rate, improving power output without increasing engine size. This allows manufacturers to create smaller, more efficient engines that produce the same or even higher performance than larger, naturally aspirated counterparts. Turbos also help reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. They are commonly found in sports cars, high-performance vehicles, and commercial trucks, where they provide the necessary power and torque for both speed and load-bearing capabilities.",

          "Description": "The Climate Control ECU manages the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in a vehicle. It ensures passenger comfort by regulating temperature, humidity, and air quality. The ECU uses data from various sensors, such as cabin temperature, outside temperature, and solar radiation, to optimize HVAC performance. Advanced systems may also integrate with navigation data to precondition the cabin based on route and traffic conditions.",
